### Introduction

- This event will be recorded and posted publicly to YouTube. These notes will also be shared with other attendees and the public.
- Our event moderators today (thank you!) are:
     - Tania
     - Smera
- This event is supported by the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open-source Software for Science grants](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/) via the [Scientific Python project](https://scientific-python.org/).
- This event is organized and run by staff at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org).
- Today’s topic is designed for people who work and spend time on the internet who want to learn accessibility basics in applied situations. No expertise about accessibility or other topics is needed.

### Game Rules

- The host will pose a scenario and a related question
- Polls with the question will appear in the Zoom messages
- Participants have 30 seconds to answer the poll
- The host will review the poll and address the most popular answer as well as host’s recommendation
- Host will tally up the answers you give against my recommendations

### Planning a meeting

- Good tip: title the meeting with a longer but more complete title to provide enough context about the meeting 
- community’s agreement on a digitally accessible venue(acc. to you) is important before finalizing it :)
- Email reminders are good for those using assistive technology and “easy” to read. They are linear and have been around long enough to have good support for screen readers.

### Making a document

- Editing the doc’s title manually: ensures the title is descriptive
- Using sections to break the structure: provides some visual grouping, and structure helps people who use assistive technology to navigate documents (and websites)
- Default styling often corresponds to semantic annotation, which is why it’s good to use default styling

### Sending links

- Full URLs: if one needs to get the URL read out loud, this will be read in full

### Replying to emails

- Use common and familiar words to make sure messages are clear is good especially for those folks that might not have full context, also avoiding jargon makes the message easier to understand

### Organizing a podcast

- Checking the format of the audio file is not really helpful 
- Checking for transcripts is a good accessibility practice

### Hosting a meeting

- It is a good practice to say hello and provide a place for note-taking; this supports people with cognitive disabilities and everyone to go back and revisit information.
- Interpreters/translators can struggle if there are multiple voice inputs simultaneously.
- Too many messages can be similar to background chatter and can be distracting. 
- Though this is contextual (for example, large vs small meetings)

### Inaccessibility of things you can’t control

- Recommendation: if essential information (for example, an invite) is provided only as an image, you can write out the information as text in a reply or comment below

### Patterns of accessibility

- Make the time to do things right.
- Think before you act. Especially think through what the impact of your choices could be.
- Don’t over-optimize. Do your best and keep it simple.

### Upcoming events

Data visualization and accessibility

Data visualization is a varied and complex topic that draws on many disciplines. Many have advised on ways to make data visualizations more inclusive of people who are blind or low vision and/or deaf or hard of hearing. This event will compile existing recommendations to provide an abbreviated guide to the what and why behind making data visualizations available to more people.

**When:** Tuesday, 15 October, 2024 at 8 AM Pacific Time ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Los%20Angeles/2024-10-15/08:00/Data%20visualization%20and%20accessibility%20with%20Scientific%20Python%20and%20Quansight%20Labs))

**What attendees should know:** Basic knowledge of what a data visualization is and the names of common parts of them.
