## Resources

Needed for the event:
- [The collaborative event PR]()
- [Slides]()
- [Step by Step Images: How to Add Alt-text with Github Suggestions](https://hackmd.io/@marslee/BksnYfWVK)
- [Project we are contributing to (ie. the documentation, website, or something similar; this should be the final rendered place.)]()

Extra information: 
- [W3's Alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) (What kind of alt text does this image need?)
- [WebAim's overview of alt text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) (What is alt text and what does it need to do?)
- [Diagram Center's standards for alt text for graphs and charts](http://diagramcenter.org/table-of-contents-2.html#toc) (How do I describe images with a lot of data?)
- [Alt text style guide for Jupyter accessibility workshops](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-accessibility-workshops/blob/fd1d7f96ca40943eda050a339ba64bcf16dd638a/docs/alt-text-guide.md) (This may be useful for non-Jupyter projects since it makes some choices regarding styling for you.)

## How to participate

1. Go to [our working PR]() and review the list of files needing alt text.
2. Comment on the PR which file you plan to work on. You can work as a team if desired!
3. Write alt text for an image.
4. Submit that alt text on the PR via a single-comment suggestion. [Step by Step Images: How to Add Alt-text with Github Suggestions](https://hackmd.io/@marslee/BksnYfWVK). 

**Note:** If there is an image you want to add alt text to that is not yet in the PR, tell [event host] and they can add it.


6. Repeat steps 2 through 4 as much as you'd like. Be sure to coordinate with others to cover as much of the blog as we can.
7. **Optional:** If you have time, you can team up with other participants and give feedback on each others' alt text.
8. You did it! Great work! 

## Alt text review checklist

These are a few of the main things we need to make sure are met for formatting consistent alt text.

The alt text has
- [ ] Correct spelling and no typos
- [ ] Periods and commas where relevant
- [ ] No more than three short, complete sentences
- [ ] A logical way of fitting in the rest of the documentation
- [ ] Consistent text and/or descriptions for the same elements in different images
- [ ] A description of any text in the image

## Questions

We'll try and answer questions during the event, but often people have questions that will require a little research or we just plain run out of time. Feel free to leave questions so we can get back to them post-event.

- [Your questions here! Adding your name is optional.]
