## How to contribute

⭐ For full info about how to interact with this PR, please visit the [How to Participate section of the agenda](). Please contribute via [suggestions](https://hackmd.io/@marslee/BksnYfWVK) so we can easily review each other's work and give you credit in the commit history!

✏️ If you plan to work on a file, let people know by commenting below. You can do this as a group, and you can write alt text for as many images as you'd like. We can have multiple suggestions for the same alt text, but it would be nice if we spread out to cover more images.

📚 If you need a reference for how to format your suggestions, [alt text in Markdown files (ends with `.md`) follow this format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1) while [alt text in RST files (ends with `.rst`) follow this format](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/images.html).

> *The below section is optional, review if your contribution is all new alt text, or you will be editing existing*

🖼️ There are two types of images in this PR: ones that already have alt text and ones that have none. 
- Images that appear in this PR with existing alt text are still worth reviewing and editing! If you think they could benefit from a different description, please suggest one.
- Images with no alt text need a description added in place of the blank.

❗ If you think an image is missing from these files, let @[event host] know and they will add it to the PR.
