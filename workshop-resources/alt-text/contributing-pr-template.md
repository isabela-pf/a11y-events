This PR adds or updates existing [alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples) to [project name]. It includes alt text for
- List where contributions happen.
- There may be only one location or multiple.
- This helps reviewers orient themselves.
- And helps event participants quantify their contributions.

If there are images in this repo you think were missed, I'd love to know so we can address them in the future.

If you have any questions about reviewing alt text, let me know and I'd be happy to tell you what I review for.

Thanks in advance for reviewing this PR! ðŸŒ»

This alt text was contributed by wonderful volunteers at the [project name alt text workshops]()! They teamed up to make progress on so many images. 

If you are curious how we have a commit authored by multiple people), feel free to check out [our working PR]() or the [How to Participate section of the event agenda]().
