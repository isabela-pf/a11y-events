> *Contributing PRs are the pull requests from an event host's fork of the main project to the main project (the upstream repo). This PR template provides a framework for summarizing the changes contibuted, offers support to the reviewer in case they have questions about this type of contribution, and mentions that this was a collaborative effort.*

> *This PR template should be used as an addition to the main project's own PR template (if they have one). Be sure to answer what they ask of you in their template to the best of your ability and respect their contributing guidelines.*

> *Please delete any comments using the `>*text here*` syntax before using this template in the wild.*

This PR adds or updates existing [alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples) to [project name]. It includes alt text for
- List files or links where contributions happen.
- There may be only one location or multiple.
- This helps reviewers orient themselves.
- And helps event participants quantify their contributions.

If there are images in this repo you think were missed, I'd love to know so we can address them in the future.

If you have any questions about reviewing alt text, let me know and I'd be happy to tell you what I review for.

Thanks in advance for reviewing this PR! ðŸŒ»

This alt text was contributed by wonderful volunteers at the [project name alt text workshops]()! They teamed up to make progress on so many images. 

If you are curious how we have a commit authored by multiple people), feel free to check out [our working PR]() or the [How to Participate section of the event agenda]().
