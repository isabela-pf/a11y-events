3. Using the steps listed in your section of the working PR and the Resources section of this agenda, review the interface.
4. Take note of what happens when completing review steps, making sure you can reproduce the review as needed. Mark down any questions you have as well!
5. Make sure to note fill out all areas in your section, even if you need to mark them as n/a  or not completable. While you can always add more information, these are the foundation.
6. Submit your review notes on the PR via single-comment [GitHub suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request).

7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 as much as you'd like. Be sure to coordinate with others to cover as much as we can.
8. **Optional:** If you have time, you can team up with other participants and give feedback on each others' review.
9. You did it! Great work! 

## Review checklist

These are a few of the main things we need to make sure our reviews are trackable and reproducible.

The review has
- [ ] All requested information has been added or marked "n/a"
- [ ] There is enough information that someone could recreate the review task (it's reproducible)
- [ ] If an area could not be completed, it is marked "could not be completed" with additional notes as needed
- [ ] The review is added as a [GitHub suggestion](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) (so reviewers get credit)

## Questions

We'll try and answer questions during the event, but often people have questions that will require a little research or we just plain run out of time. Feel free to leave questions so we can get back to them post-event.
