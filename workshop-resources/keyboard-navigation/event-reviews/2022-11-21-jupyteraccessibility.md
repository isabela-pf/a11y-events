## Review

For this review, participants select a test they would like to complete and apply it to as many areas or states of the interface as they want in the given time.

### General notes

This is the place for anything a reviewer thinks is important that doesn't belong below. This could be something out of scope of the review, something that will impact all other tests, or the like.

Notes:

### Content order

When accessed via keyboard, the content order is logical. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.
2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.
3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck.

Does the content order follow reviewer expectations based on reading the content?
Result:

Does the content order make sense for interacting with the content?
Result:

Are any major content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?
Result:

Are any interactive content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?
Result:

Other notes or recommendations:

### Areas to navigate

All areas of the tool can be accessed using keyboard navigation. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

1. Navigate via the Tab key major content areas
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate within major content areas.

| Area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate fully within the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate out of the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navigation 1 | a | b | c |
| Navigation 2 | d | e | f |
| Aside/related content | g | h | i |
| Main area | j | k | l |
| Main area section | m | n | o |
| Footer | p | q | r |

Other notes by area:

### Keyboard/tab traps

When navigating via keyboard, there are no areas where keyboard focus can enter but not exit. The focus never gets "trapped." ([WCAG 2.2 No keyboard trap](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.
2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.
3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck. If the reviewer can make it to all content, please note.
4. Optional: complete steps 1â€“3 over any areas that may have been missed by the content order. Using the mouse to move focus to an area and trying to tab out may be helpful for these cases.

Keyboard/tab traps:
- tab trap 1
- tab trap 2

Other notes or recommendations:

### Skip links

When using keyboard navigation, there is a link to switch keyboard focus directly to the tool's main content and skip header navigation or repeated content. ([WCAG 2.2 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key. If you have already been interacting with the page, reviewer may need to reload page and then press Tab.
2. Once focus is on the skip link, press Space or Enter to activate it.

### Interactive Areas

All buttons, links, form fields, or similar interactive areas can be both accessed and activated using only the keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

1. Navigate via the Tab key to interactive areas. 
2. Activate interactive areas using the Enter or Spacebar key.

| Interactive area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to input information (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to activate the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Button 1| a | b | c |
| Button 2| d | e | f |
| Button 3 | g | h | i |
| Link 1 | j | k | l |
| Link 2 | m | n | o |
| Form field 1 | p | q | r |
| Add table rows as needed! |  |  |  |
| |  |  |  |

### Focus

There is a visible focus state for all content. It appears by default when navigating via keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content. 
2. If end of content cannot be reached, the reviewer may report on what they could interact with.
3. If the reviewer is comfortable, they may also use the browser inspector to select an area and toggle focus per area.

Is there visible focus styling? If so, please briefly describe it.

Other notes or recommendations:

### Mixed input

It is possible to complete tasks while switching between input mechanisms, for example using a keyboard and mouse and touch screen. ([WCAG 2.2 Concurrent input mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#concurrent-input-mechanisms))

1. Locate an interactive area.
2. Complete the interaction using keyboard controls.
3. Complete the interaction using the mouse.
4. Complete the interaction using touch controls.
5. If the task has multiple steps, the reviewer can try using a different interaction for each step.
6. Repeat as needed across interactive areas.

#### Task name + region

Repeat this section as needed for each task or region the reviewer evaluates.

Does the task have multiple steps? If yes, please list them.

Result:

Can the task be completed with only mouse controls?
Result:

Can the task be completed with only touch screen contorls?
Result:

### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts--key combinations that initiate an action-- may not inhibit keyboard navigation. Keyboard shortcuts also need to be configurable. ([WCAG 2.2 Character key shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#character-key-shortcuts))

[List of shortcuts for this tool]().

1. Search for where keyboard shortcut settings may be edited.
2. Review list of keyboard shortcuts.
