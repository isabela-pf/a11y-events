## Review

For this review, participants select a test they would like to complete and apply it to as many areas or states of the interface as they want in the given time. There are two pages with different structure to be reviewed below, the [Home page](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [Theme Structure and Layout page](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/layout.html).

### General notes

This is the place for anything a reviewer thinks is important that doesn't belong below. This could be something out of scope of the review, something that will impact all other tests, or the like.

#### Content order

When accessed via keyboard, the content order is logical. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.
2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.
3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck.

Does the content order follow reviewer expectations based on reading the content?

Does the content order make sense for interacting with the content?

#### Areas to navigate

All areas of the tool can be accessed using keyboard navigation. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

1. Navigate via the Tab key major content areas
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate within major content areas.

| Area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate fully within the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate out of the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Banner | a | b | c |
| Main menu bar | d | e | f |
| Main content area | g | h | i |
| Main area | j | k | l |
| Bottom of page navigation | m | n | o |
| Footer | p | q | r |
| Other (add as needed) | s | t | u |

Other notes by area:

#### Keyboard/tab traps

When navigating via keyboard, there are no areas where keyboard focus can enter but not exit. The focus never gets "trapped." ([WCAG 2.2 No keyboard trap](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.
2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.
3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck. If the reviewer can make it to all content, please note.
4. Optional: complete steps 1–3 over any areas that may have been missed by the content order. Using the mouse to move focus to an area and trying to tab out may be helpful for these cases.

Keyboard/tab traps:
- tab trap 1
- tab trap 2

Other notes or recommendations:

#### Skip links

When using keyboard navigation, there is a link to switch keyboard focus directly to the tool's main content and skip header navigation or repeated content. ([WCAG 2.2 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key. If you have already been interacting with the page, reviewer may need to reload page and then press Tab.
2. Once focus is on the skip link, press Space or Enter to activate it.

#### Interactive Areas

All buttons, links, form fields, or similar interactive areas can be both accessed and activated using only the keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

2. Activate interactive areas using the Enter or Spacebar key.

| Interactive area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to input information (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to activate the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
