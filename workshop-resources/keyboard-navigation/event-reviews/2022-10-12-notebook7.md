## Review

### Content order

When accessed via keyboard, the content order is logical. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.
2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.
3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck.

Does the content order follow reviewer expectations based on reading the content?
Result: It goes from top to bottom and left to right, which makes sense for an English keyboard. I am able to loop from the end of the document back to the top, so that meets my expectations as well.

I cannot identify the content order in its entirety because of the lack of visible focus indicator (see below). The content order may make sense, but I cannot tell.

Does the content order make sense for interacting with the content?
Result:

Are any major content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?
Result: While the whole content order is not entirely clear based on this evaluation, we did notice areas missing in the file browser. Missing areas included
- Files and Running tabs
- File sorting UI (like Name and Last Modified ordering)

Are any interactive content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?
Result:

Other notes or recommendations:

### Areas to navigate

All areas of the tool can be accessed using keyboard navigation. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

1. Navigate via the Tab key major content areas
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate within major content areas.

| Area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate fully within the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate out of the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menubar | yes | yes | yes but leaves incorrect `lm-mod-active` class on last active item |
| Files or Running panel in tree view | no | - | - |
| New/upload/refresh buttons | yes | yes | yes |
| Searchbar in tree view | yes | yes | yes |
| Breadcrumbs | - | - | - |
| Columns of the file browser | no | - | - |
| File browser | yes | yes | yes |
| Running panel | no | no (only the Shut Down All button) | yes |
| File editor | yes | - | yes (after pressing Esc) |
| Notebook toolbar excess items (see screenshot) | no | yes (after focusing with a click) | yes |
| Notebook cells | yes | yes | yes |

Other notes by area:
- JupyterLab cannot switch between split areas https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4407

### Keyboard/tab traps

When navigating via keyboard, there are no areas where keyboard focus can enter but not exit. The focus never gets "trapped." ([WCAG 2.2 No keyboard trap](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap))

From the above section (Areas to navigate), please list all areas where the reviewer could not navigate out of using the keyboard. Notes are welcome!

Keyboard/tab traps:
- terminal seems like a really bad trap. Cannot get out with tab, shift tab, escape key, or Alt + D (shortcut to focus address bar in my browser - Firefox). I can escape by Ctrl + Shift + C (command palette) after which I can tab around again!
- file editor (text file): Cannot escape by using tab or shift + tab, but can escape with "Escape" key (after I can tab either forward or backward).
- Notebook editor: Code cell editor: Cannot escape by tab/shift+tab. Can escape with "Escape" key, but focus is put somewhere where the next focus item is the cell toolbar of the cell you just escaped, which is earlier in the tab order than the editor itself, so you cannot go past the editor. You can go backwards, but that starts from before the first cell, so it is impossible to tab to a cell in the middle of the notebook.
- Console: Same issue as Notebook editor where using "Escape" key to get out of editor will re-trap you when you hit continue tabbing. It does however seem to be the last element on the page, so probably not as bad of a problem.

Other notes or recommendations:
- Could not figure out how to open a running terminal from the "running tab", was only able to expand collapse sections...
- If I hide the header (command palette, untoggle "Show Header"), I still tab through the hidden element?
- In the terminal, I was able to tab into the codemirror editor for the previous cells somehow. Some of the things I did was: Turn on "Show all Kernel actrivity", enter Zen mode, open the palette and tab further. Somehow I was able to enter the CM editor and insert tabs. See screenshot below.

- Please check focus reset after Command Palette -> Find... -> Escape to exit out. I would expect focus to go back where I was prior to the command palette (e.g. in a specific cell editor).


### Skip links

When using keyboard navigation, there is a link to switch keyboard focus directly to the tool's main content and skip header navigation or repeated content. ([WCAG 2.2 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key. If you have already been interacting with the page, reviewer may need to reload page and then press Tab.
2. Once focus is on the skip link, press Space or Enter to activate it.  

Is there a skip link?
Result: There does not appear to be one in either the file tree page or the notebook page.  I inspected html source in browser, but quick searches found nothing.

Is the skip link prompt visible?
Result: No visible prompt on pages tested.

What does the skip link prompt skip?
Result: N/A

Where does the skip link prompt move user focus to?
Result: N/A

Does the skip link behavior meet reviewer expectations?
Result: No; there should be skip link(s) to skip over menu bar(s), straight to main page content.

Other notes or recommendations: https://github.com/ offers a basic working example of skip links for comparison.

### Interactive Areas

All buttons, links, form fields, or similar interactive areas can be both accessed and activated using only the keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))

1. Navigate via the Tab key to interactive areas. 
2. Activate interactive areas using the Enter or Spacebar key.

| Interactive area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to input information (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to activate the area (yes/no/not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Button 1| a | b | c |
| Button 2| d | e | f |
| Button 3 | g | h | i |
| Link 1 | j | k | l |
| Link 2 | m | n | o |
| Form field 1 | p | q | r |
| Add table rows as needed! |  |  |  |
| |  |  |  |

### Focus

There is a visible focus state for all content. It appears by default when navigating via keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible))

1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content. 

Result: pressing the Tab key repeatedly moves the focus around the interface, but it doesn't give focus to all the elements of the UI. There's no focus to the sidebars items, though items inside the opened sidebar are getting focus.
2. If end of content cannot be reached, the reviewer may report on what they could interact with.

Result: The end content can be reached, and it will circle back to the starting point of the document.
3. If the reviewer is comfortable, they may also use the browser inspector to select an area and toggle focus per area.

Is there visible focus styling? If so, please briefly describe it.
Result: 

- Jupyterlab main areas have a blue margin for the sidebar contents and links inside the notebook. 
- Jupyterlab main menu has a hover color over the menu that is focused.
- The user is not able to change the files, and there's no way to have a visible way to see which one is selected. (When done with the mouse it does have a hover color)
- The menubar for the notebook has a hover color on the focused item.




Is the focus styling consistent throughout?
Result:

- In the menus, sidebar, lists and tree views it is pretty consistent. It has the same hover color and behavior throughout the interface
- The main content areas are not consistent in the blue margin, some items in the menus inside the sidebars have it,
<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20992645/195414449-3d1f3651-74e0-402f-963f-2ce4a4614bbf.png">
- The behavior of hovering/colors/interactions is not the same doing it by the keyboard than doing it with the mouse.
- There's a dialog that appears to go to the left sidebar, but I couldn't use it

Are there any areas without visible focus styling?
Result: The change from sidebar to the notebook and afterwards is tricky because there's no visible focus styling.

Was the reviewer ever unclear about where their keyboard focus was during the review? If so, please note where or why.
Result:

Some items are not focused because the user will not be able to make any action, but it makes the interaction weird. For example, the only item that you are able to get focus in the status bar is the first one (which is the only one that has an action associated). Also the focus changes in the different type of documents that you can open in the main content area.

Other notes or recommendations:

### Mixed input

It is possible to complete tasks while switching between input mechanisms, for example using a keyboard and mouse and touch screen. ([WCAG 2.2 Concurrent input mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#concurrent-input-mechanisms))

1. Locate an interactive area.
2. Complete the interaction using keyboard controls.
3. Complete the interaction using the mouse.
4. Complete the interaction using touch controls.
5. If the task has multiple steps, the reviewer can try using a different interaction for each step.
6. Repeat as needed across interactive areas.

#### Task name + region

Does the task have multiple steps? If yes, please list them.
Result:

Can the task be completed with only keyboard controls?
Result:

Can the task be completed with only mouse controls?
Result:

Can the task be completed with only touch screen contorls?
Result:

### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts--key combinations that initiate an action-- may not inhibit keyboard navigation. Keyboard shortcuts also need to be configurable. ([WCAG 2.2 Character key shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#character-key-shortcuts))

[List of shortcuts for this tool]().

1. Search for where keyboard shortcut settings may be edited.
2. Review list of keyboard shortcuts.
3. Choose a shortcut and answer the prompts.
4. Repeat as needed.

Can shortcuts be turned off?
Result: Not in the file browser or notebook UI, we should add this feature

Can shortcuts be configured (remapped to different keys than the default)?
Result: Not in the file browser or notebook UI, we should add this feature

Do any shortcuts conflict with browser or operating system controls?
Result: Yes, but in relevant situations (*e.g.*, for copy and paste), this seems okay

Other notes or recommendations:

#### Shortcut name

Shortcut keys:

How many keys are needed?
Result: 

How close together are the keys?
Result:

Does the shortcut only activate when focus is on the related part of the interface?
Result:
