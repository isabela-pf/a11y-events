# Alt text/image description Workshops

Learn how to surf the web with a keyboard and contribute feedback for keyboard navigation fixes! 

Keyboard navigation review workshops gather community to learn and practice expected keyboard navigation behavior. Participants also learn foundational tests they can perform and how to describe and present these issues constructively. This can be done confidently for any web interface, and could be adapted to desktop apps. At the end, everyone's work gets wrapped up to a neat for contribution back to the main project.
