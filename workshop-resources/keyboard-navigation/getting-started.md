# Getting started with keyboard navigation

## What to press to navigate with a keyboard

- Tab: go to the next focusable element
- Shift + Tab: go to the previous focusable element
- Enter or Space: activate interactive area (like buttons) or confirm a selection
- Arrow keys: navigate within a focusable element (like selecting items within a menu)

## Common terms

### Assistive technology

Any technology that enables disabled users to fully interact with interfaces by providing interaction support beyond those offered by mainstream technology. Common examples include screen magnifiers, screen readers, alternative keyboards, or alternative pointing devices. These may be used in combination.

For more in-depth and comprehensive defining, refer to [WCAG 2.2's definition of assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-assistive-technologies).

### Keyboard focus

It may also be called focus. When navigating with a keyboard, this is the point on a page where the user is currently navigated. This area can be described as "having focus."

If you use a mouse, it might be helpful to imagine this as your mouse pointer. Your mouse pointer must move the the area you want to interact with before you can interact with it. This is also true of keyboard focus, though keyboard focus may also be important for non-interactive areas like if you used the mouse pointer to follow along as you read a paragraph.

Keyboard focus may also be used to broadly group other qualities required for an accessible focus state. Someone might say an element is "missing focus" and mean that there is no visual [focus indicator](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-focus-indicator) to tell them where keyboard focus currently is. 

### Skip link

An informal term shortened from "skip navigation link." It is a prompt that appears at the top of a page (usually invisible until the user presses the `Tab` key) that allows users to skip a page's navigation and move focus directly to the page's main content. This can help save time for users who are familiar with or do not need to know the page's navigation.

For more discussion on skip links, refer to [WebAIM's Skip Navigation Link article](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/).

### Tab

In this situation, tab refers to either the `Tab` key on a keyboard or the action of using the `Tab` key to navigate an interface. 

For example, the review template asks reviewers to "press Tab" in reference to the keyboard key. This is the noun example. The host is also likely to tell reviewers to "tab through" an area to check for any skipped content. This is the verb example.

### Tab trap

An informal term used to describe when keyboard focus can be moved to a point in the interface but cannot be moved away from that point, "trapping" the tab navigation in one spot. It may also be called a keyboard trap.
